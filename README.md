## Features

- Retrieve passwords by entering the account name.
- Copy passwords to the clipboard for quick access.

## Prerequisites

    Run the script.

python password_manager.py

Usage

    Launch the program.
    Enter the name of the account for which you want to retrieve the password.
    If the account exists, the password will be copied to the clipboard.
